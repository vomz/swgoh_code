BARRISS_OFFEE_UPDATE_MESSAGE|Our team has identified an issue with Barriss Offee in which allies were still recovering 20% Max Health whenever they were critically hit even after Barriss was no longer present in the battle. This has been flagged as a bug as her Zeta ability was not meant to persist after death. Today, we will be removing the Zeta upgrade and granting them back to each respective player via inbox message in order to allow them the ability to choose whether or not they want to invest in this character again. We apologize for any inconvenience!

CantinaChar_Challenges_FirstUnlock003|Each Challenge will give you important [f0ff23]REWARDS[-]
CantinaChar_Challenges_FirstUnlock004|Some Challenges give you [f0ff23]TRAINING DROIDS[-] so you can train your characters to increase their stats.

CantinaChar_Challenges_FirstUnlock007|And finally, [f0ff23]CREDITS[-]. You can use those all over the place!
CantinaChar_Challenges_FirstUnlock008|As it is in war, defeating a Challenge isn't always about using the strongest squad. It's about choosing the right squad for the job.
CantinaChar_Challenges_FirstUnlock009|Pay attention to the rules for a given Challenge. They can dramatically affect what happens in battle.
CantinaChar_Challenges_FirstUnlock010|Tap a Challenge panel to see the rules of engagement.
CantinaChar_Challenges_FirstUnlock011|I'll start you off with some simple battles. But later on, I won't go so easy on you. Good luck.

CantinaChar_FleetWar_FirstUnlock002|This is the [f0ff23]GALACTIC WAR[-] table. You can attempt to defeat this table only [f0ff23]ONCE PER DAY[-]--make it count!
CantinaChar_FleetWar_FirstUnlock003|You will play a series of battles against other players' squads.
CantinaChar_FleetWar_FirstUnlock004|It will start easy and get harder the further you progress on the battlefield.
CantinaChar_FleetWar_FirstUnlock005|Important! The health of each character carries over from battle to battle. Keep this in mind!
CantinaChar_FleetWar_FirstUnlock006|Also! Any units that are defeated during a Galactic War cannot be used on this table for the rest of the day.
CantinaChar_FleetWar_FirstUnlock007|Defeated units can, of course, be used on other tables. Just not here until your Galactic War resets.
CantinaChar_FleetWar_FirstUnlock008|After each successful battle, you will be able to open a [f0ff23]SPECIAL REWARD CHEST[-]. Enjoy the spoils of war.
CantinaChar_FleetWar_FirstUnlock009|The further you progress, the greater the rewards.
CantinaChar_FleetWar_FirstUnlock010|Be sure to check the table's [f0ff23]GALACTIC WAR STORE[-] to redeem the [f0ff23]GALACTIC WAR TOKENS[-] you've earned.
CantinaChar_FleetWar_FirstUnlock011|If you forget how the table works, tap the [f0ff23]RULES[-] button to learn more.

CONTEXTUALMSG_FEATUREINTRO_MODSETCOMPLETED_04|Tap here to learn more about Mod Set Bonuses.
CONTEXTUALMSG_FEATUREINTRO_MODSETCOMPLETED_05|Some sets require two of the same Mod Type whereas others require four. 
CONTEXTUALMSG_FEATUREINTRO_MODSETCOMPLETED_06|That means you're able to combine the effects of a single four piece set with that of a two piece.
CONTEXTUALMSG_FEATUREINTRO_MODSETCOMPLETED_07|Or you're able to fashion together three complete, two piece sets!

CONTEXTUALMSG_FEATUREINTRO_MODUPGRADED_01|When I successfully Upgrade a Mod, it will always result in an increase of its Primary Stat.

CONTEXTUALMSG_FEATUREINTRO_MODUPGRADED_03|Upgrading a Mod to its next level takes longer as it reaches higher levels, but with each Upgrade, I get closer to upgrading the Mod to its next level.

Track your personal contribution to your guild in the new Guild Activities section in the Guild area of the Cantina.\n\nDue to this change, we are going to grant some Guild Bank Coins to offset any loss of Coins accrued. In addition, we know that last week there was a server bug where Guilds completed a Raid with a single individual doing an extraordinary amount of damage. Due to this bug, we've decided to increase the amount of Guild Bank Coins your Guild will receive, from 15,000 to 75,000.\n\nAll Guilds will receive 75,000 Guild Bank Coins when the Guild Leader logs in.

DYNAMICDESC_LAYOUT_AAT_DIFF01_PHASE01_TEXT|[23C8F5]On one of the many battlefields of the Clone Wars, the nefarious General Grievous has made a rare appearance to personally direct the battle. Defeating him here would surely turn the tide of the war![-]
DYNAMICDESC_LAYOUT_AAT_DIFF01_PHASE02_TEXT|[23C8F5]Grievous's patience has worn thin--he orders one of his dreaded AATs to cover his retreat. With nigh-impervious armor and a small arsenal of anti-personnel weaponry, it is one of the deadliest weapons on the battlefield.[-]
DYNAMICDESC_LAYOUT_AAT_DIFF01_PHASE03_TEXT|[23C8F5]The AAT has been disabled, but the battle is far from over--Grievous summons a squad of B1 Battle Droids, led by one of his special B2 Rocket Troopers, to hold the line while the AAT is repaired.[-]

DYNAMICDESC_LAYOUT_RANCOR_DIFF01_PHASE02_TEXT|[23C8F5]The terror residing within the inner sanctum has been unleashed. Riled from the sounds of battle, the Rancor's enduring defenses are nearly impenetrable. Beware of its insatiable appetite![-]
DYNAMICDESC_LAYOUT_RANCOR_DIFF01_PHASE03_TEXT|[23C8F5]Taking on a more aggressive nature, the Rancor is more susceptible to damage. Sometimes, however, the best defense is a strong, debilitating offense.[-]
DYNAMICDESC_LAYOUT_RANCOR_DIFF01_PHASE04_TEXT|[23C8F5]Wounded but not tiring, the Rancor's rage during its final stand is unquestionable.[-]

NEWSLETTER_KRENNIC_AND_DEATH_TROOPER_DESC|Two new characters have arrived, DIRECTOR KRENNIC and the DEATH TROOPER! These powerful Imperial characters have great synergy together and are specialized in taking out Rebels.\n\nDirector Krennic is a potent support character that uses powerful debuffs against his foes, including the all-new debuff STAGGER! This debuff is inflicted using his DEATH TROOPER ASSAULT ability, and removes 100% turn meter when the Staggered enemy takes damage. When Director Krennic uses his EXPERIMENTAL WEAPONRY ability, he will inflict a different type of debuff on each type of character, such as stunning Attackers, inflicting ability block on Healers, and placing Buff Immunity on Tanks.\n\nDeath Trooper is a powerful attacker and the perfect addition to a squad with Director Krennic in it. Whenever the Death Trooper scores a critical hit, he and Director Krennic recover Health. The DEATH TROOPER'S GRENADE ability removes all buffs from enemies and inflicts healing immunity on them, punishing squads that rely on buffs. TERMINATE is the Death Trooper’s most powerful ability, guaranteeing a critical hit if the enemy has any debuffs on them and making them unable to be revived if defeated by it once upgraded.\n\nUnlock both of these powerful new units in the all-new SPECIAL OPERATIONS Marquee Event!

NEWSLETTER_POWER_FORMULA_CHANGE_DESC|The Power rating has long been a prominent display of a unit's general effectiveness. Though this rating is intended to be a useful way to identify how strong a unit is, it has become less and less effective for this purpose over time. This is primarily due to the formula being based entirely on the raw base stats of the unit, which doesn't account for all upgrades such as abilities.\n\nIn the interest of making the Power formula more reliable as a reference point for a unit's effectiveness, we've modified the formula to recognize every upgrade made to a unit. This change will result in your units appearing to have a much higher power, however this will NOT have any impact on their performance in combat. The changes are purely intended to be a shorthand representation of a unit's general effectiveness.

He is a powerful ally in any squad!\n\nCommander Luke Skywalker will unlock through the Hero's Journey event as a Seven Star character.
